A car delaership website where I've heavily focused more on animation and design using CSS3. The animation included:
1. Zooming animation 
2. Spinning wheel preloader GIF, waiting for the page to load.
3. The use of CSS3 clip path without using Adobe photohsop
4. Zooming effect for the image files when hovering the mouse to the images
5. Video background with CSS3 effects.
